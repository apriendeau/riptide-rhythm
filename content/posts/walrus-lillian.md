The Lillian is an analog, multi-stage phaser that from it's sister pedal, the Julia where you can blend between
Dry, Phase Shifted, and Vibrato. It has switch to select between 4 stages which is warm and tightened to 6 stages
which is more lush and thicker. It's name pays homage to Lillian Yonally who was apart of W.A.S.P (Women Air Force Service Pilots)
during WWII.

## Knobs

<img class="post-image" src="/images/walrus-audio/lillian-trans.png" style="width:250px; left:20%; float:left;">

The Rate knob controls the Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO) speed from a steady pace to crazy past speeds. The
Width knob controls the range of which frequencies are allowed to pass through; the higher the setting creates
a larger phasing effect. The Feedback knob controls how much much signal gets back through the phase stages.
The lower the settings will provide more of classic phaser sounds where as the high settings is where the fun
happens. The **D-P-V** knob was described earlier, which was borrowed from the Julia. It allows you to blend between Dry,
Phase Shifted, and Vibrato.

## Experience

If you are new to this format, it takes a bit of getting use to. If you are looking for a simple phaser sound, you
can dial it in but you will have to dial it in. It is not a plug and play phaser like a Phase 90 but that is where
the beauty of this pedal lies. I found myself creating new sounds with it that I preferred over the "traditional"
phasers. This brought a breath of fresh air of versitilty and new sounds that are not just "atmospheric" or "ambient"
but musical.

A potent pairing would a nice tape or lo-fi delay.

## Parting Thoughts

I tend to find myself interested in pedals that try to chase after sounds that have not previously been done before but
new sounds that I can find and mess with that I can call my own. I write only about things that intrigue me and this
pedal has delivered. It can deliver any thing from classic phases to new sounds that will make you feel like you are
soaring through the skies.
