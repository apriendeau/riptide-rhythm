I am going to break this
whole into a couple of posts and I want to focus on finishing a guitar and how I approached this Les Paul.I wanted a
Les Paul when you could still see the flame or quilted maple and the one that I loved came out of the Gibson Custom
Shop. I wanted a burst effect on the wood as well and then have that color wrap around to the back. The kit that I
used was an Albatross Guitar LP mahogany and flamed maple top. It is no longer on the internet but I found this shop
on <a href=https://arg.wtf/2A1yaNk>Etsy</a>.</p><p>After ordering the kit and hours of reading Facebook posts about this, I decided to use
<a href=https://www.kedadyeinc.com/>Keda Dyes</a>. Keith was amazing in telling me how to achieve the colors
that I wanted and super responsive. I ordered black, red and blue dyes to achieve the colors that I wanted.</p><p>For the blue, it was 1/2 teaspoon of blue dye to 8oz of lacquer thinner and doubled for the edges.For the medium purple,
it was 1/2 teaspoon of the blue and red dyes with a couple extra drops of blue into 8oz of lacquer
thinner. For the darker purple, I just doubled the amount of the dyes to the 8oz. The guitar was meant to be blue
with a hint purple but I ended up liking the purple so much, I did the whole thing.</p><p>To apply the dye, I cut up an old white t-shirt and made some rags. With a well-ventilated garage and gloves, I applied the
first coat of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; blue then sanded it back using 220 grit sandpaper and repeated just rubbing the dye in a circular
pattern. I sanded between EVERY coat of dye. For the dark edges, I would blend it back into the wood with the &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
blue. I would apply the dark blue and then on the edges of the dark dye, I would apply the normal blue continuing with
a circular motion. For the purple, it was the same process as the blue but I made sure that I had enough dye to do the
mahogany on the back and neck. Each coat was a 4 hour drying period.</p><p>After resting the wood for several days and since the back was mahogany, I needed to grain fill. I decided to use
<a href=https://arg.wtf/2A05HYg>Aqua Coat</a>. Using an old rag, I rubbed on the back and took an index card and gently pulled
the excess off the neck and back. I let it dry for about an hour and then sanded it using 320 grit sandpaper and did
it again. I sanded back one last time and let it dry overnight. The neck and back weren&rsquo;t dark enough the next day so
I reapplied the stain after grain filling and it was much darker.</p><p>Now, I need to seal my finish. This is highly debated and there is no right or wrong answer just preference.
You can either go the <a href=https://arg.wtf/2A1XGSZ>Tru Oil</a> route, poly or nitro lacquer. Most guitar companies will use
lacquer because it&rsquo;s quicker than Tru Oil. It takes roughly 30 light coats of Tru Oil and hardens like lacquer after time.
I decided for this build, I wanted a gloss finish from nitro.</p><p>I decided to give <a href=https://arg.wtf/2A1Yqrf>Mohawk Tone Finish</a> a shot and to be completely honest, I really liked
this product. It was decently priced at $7 bucks a can. I only used three cans. So this process took about a week.
I would do a light coat then wait about ten minutes and repeat then 2 more times. I would wait for 4 hours and do it
again. I sanded back drippings and bad spots using 400 grit sandpaper then repeat the process about 5 more times till
I was happy with the result.</p><p>I let the lacquer cure for 2 weeks untouched. Then buffed it out. To buff a guitar, I use the Stew Mac system but other
people use car polishers to achieve the same results. I use wet sanding of 800 grit paper then continue up to 1200 grit.
I then follow starting with the medium <a href=https://arg.wtf/2A0YiIw>Stew Mac Polishing Compound</a> and then continue up from
there.</p><p>I really have come to appreciate the process of all of this because it has taken over a month to get that done but it
makes me fall in love with the guitar even more because I know that I have built designed this myself.</p></div><div class=post__footer><span><a class=category href=/categories/diy/>DIY</a><a class=category href=/categories/guitar/>guitar</a><a class=category href=/categories/luthier/>luthier</a><a class=category href=/categories/finishing/>finishing</a></span></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer__base"><ul class=footer__list><li class=footer__item>&copy;
